This is one of the short moral stories from Aesop’s Fables. It is a story that can be narrated with animal sounds!

One day in the jungle, the lion lay asleep. A little mouse playing about runs up and down on the sleeping lion.moral stories for kids

“Aaargh!” roared the lion and held up the squeaking little mouse.

“Please let me go! Let me go! I will help you one day for your kindness today!” squealed the little mouse.

“You’re too tiny to help me! Off you go,” said the lion amused as the little mouse ran away.

A few days go by when the little mouse heard a roar: “Help me!”

The little mouse was scared but it walked on and on until it came across the lion caught in the net!

“I see you need my help now!” it said.
